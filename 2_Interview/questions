: Tell me about Class Component and Functional Component
: Class uses this.state and lifecycle methods. Functional uses hooks (useState, useEffect). Functional is simpler and preferred now.

: What is Redux and how you used it in your project?
: Redux is a state management library that stores data in one central store. I used it for user login, authentication, and API data to avoid prop drilling.

: Why do you use useState?
: To manage and update data inside a component, like input values or toggle states.

: Why do you use useEffect?
: To run side effects like API calls, timers, or actions when a component loads or updates.

: What other hooks do you use apart from useState and useEffect?
: useContext (avoid prop drilling), useRef (access DOM or store values), useMemo (optimize performance), useCallback (memoize functions).

: Do you use console.log? Why?
: Yes, for debugging — to check API data, props, state values, and code flow. I don’t keep it in production code.
